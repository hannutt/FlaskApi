Python Flask and JavaScript REST API with MongoDB.
This has been done mainly for my own purposes, i.e. testing my MongoDB databases.
The main idea is that you can access multiple mongoDB databases with a single program using api calls or an html interface.

Main features

The program can search all mongodb databases and their collections on the computer. After the search, the user can select them for use via the HTML user interface.
you can perform CRUD operations on the database you have selected. Selecting a database is easy, select a database from the dropdown menu and click the Select button
Various API calls like search or delete by id, name, etc. are also available.
You can choose whether you want to see the data in json format or in text format on the html page.
JQUERY functions facilitate CRUD operations.
